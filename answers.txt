Q)What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A)Git simply moves the pointer forward. To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with
  a commit that can be reached by following the first commit’s history, Git simplifies things by moving the 
  pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together — this is called a fast-forward.

Q)Why should you have different branches?
A)Branching allows each developer to branch out from the original code base and isolate their work from others.
  It also helps Git to easily merge versions later on.

Q)In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
A)We usually have one Git repository for  project, if it is too large to maintain under one repository
  then we could use multiple repositories.
